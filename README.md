Code for analysis of temporal variability in long-term monitoring of stream fish communities

## File descriptions
`projectScript.R` is the current working version of the source code for this project. All other source files were combined into this one following 08 March 2018 in-person meeting.

`.csv` files are data files required to run the script

## Helpful hints for running script
-There is a list of necessary package at the start. All need to be installed prior to running

-Press `<alt> + o` to fold the code and show only the main and subheadings
 
-You will need to set a working directory using `setwd()` in the `Data prep` section
