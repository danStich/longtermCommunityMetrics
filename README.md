# longtermCommunityMetrics
Code for analysis of temporal variability in long-term monitoring of stream fish communities

## File descriptions
longtermCommunityMetrics.R is the main analysis file in the repository. It is a cleaned-up version of the initial commit for R_script_CV_2-14-18.R, but looked different enough to warrant a new name. All changes to the analysis are pushed to this file.

functions.R contains a number of function declarations that are sourced at the begining of longtermCommunityMetrics.r
